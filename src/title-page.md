## Acknowledgement

This book use the same organization of this [rust-cookbook fork](https://github.com/jamesgraves/rust-cookbook), as a consequence :
* All examples are runnable via `cargo run --example`

This makes it easier for users to run the examples that are incompatible with the Rust Playground

* All examples are testable via `cargo test`
* All examples are checkable with clippy via `cargo clippy --all-targets`
